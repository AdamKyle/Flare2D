# Flare2D


Flare 2d is a simple unity project.

Flare 2d is heavy in development and is inspired by games like maple story.

## Planned Features:

- Quests
- Battles with monsters
- Inventory System
- Stat System

The idea is that this will eventually sync in with [Flare](https://github.com/AdamKyle/flare) also known as [Planes of Tlessa](https://planesoftlessa.com).

If you want to play the web build version, check out: [Flare 2D Web Build Project](https://github.com/AdamKyle/Flare2dWebBuild/tree/master) which you only have to clone and open the html file while a web server is running for the game to load.
